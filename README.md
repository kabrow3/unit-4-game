# unit-4-game

This is the Crystal Game Project.

It was completed for the fourth Homework Assignment for the Coding Boot Camp.

It is based in javascript and jQuery.

It generates a random goal number as well as four crystal buttons with random numbers assigned to each of them. The object is to reach the goal number by clicking on the various crystal buttons and adding amounts to your score.

The game keeps track and displays the goal number, the current score of the user, the instructions for the game, and number of wins and losses so far, the title of the game, and the crystal buttons themselves.

After a game is won or lost, the win/loss record is updated, the goal number is reset and the values of each crystal button are reset as well.
